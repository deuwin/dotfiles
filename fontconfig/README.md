# Font Fallback
`fonts.conf` sets a custom font family that can be used by Alacritty to help
ensure decent rendering of NerdFont symbols and other code points within the
wider Unicode standard.

First saw this
[here](https://blog.sebastian-daschner.com/entries/linux-terminal-font-alacritty-jetbrains-mono-emoji).
Didn't care for the emojis, but did want the occasional piece of Unicode to
render well.
